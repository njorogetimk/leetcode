## Leet problem [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `True` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `False` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Example 1:

> Input: `s = "abc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`

> Output: `True`

### Example 2:

> Input: `s = "axc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`

> Output: `False`

### Constraints:

> `0 <= s.length <= 100`

> `0 <= t.length <= 104`

> `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
